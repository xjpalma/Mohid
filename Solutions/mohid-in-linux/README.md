# MOHID instalation in Linux machines #
---
This repository is an attempt to compile MOHID in a linux machine with Ubuntu or CentOS linux distro and intel compiler ifort.

## Minimum system requirements ##
Install the following softwares:
* intel compiler C and Fortran
* zlib
* hdf5
* netcdf
* proj4
* proj4fortran
* intel mpi or mpich or openMPI, etc.(optional)
* mohid src

or
**Install intel compiler first!** and after use ``./install_req.sh -opt1 -opt2 ...`` to install library requirements
`install_req.sh` will download and install all libraries required to compile MOHID. **You must respect the instalation order**. To see help menu run:
```
./install_req.sh -h
```
**Update all paths in script to fit your setup.**

## Compile ##
To compile MOHID Water and/or MOHID Land, you must compile first MOHID Base 1 and MOHID Base 2. This will create all .mod files used to compile MOHID.
```
./compile.sh -v -mb1 -mb2
```
To compile MOHID Water run:
```
./compile.sh -v -mw
```
To compile MOHID Land run:
```
./compile.sh -v -ml
```
For more information or see all option available, run:
```
./compile.sh -h
```
Update all paths in script to fit your setup.

## Test the installation ##
Inside test directory there are two test cases, one for mohid water and another one for mohid land. Just execute `mohid-in-linux/test/mohidwater/25m_deep/exe/MohidWater.exe` or `mohid-in-linux/test/mohidland/schematicWatershed/exe/MohidLand.exe` to see if there's no errors.

If you see `Program Mohid Water successfully terminated` or `Program Mohid Land successfully terminated`, your installation was sucessfull.

If you want to run your own project, make a link for `bin/MohidWater.exe` or `bin/MohidLand.exe`

```
ln -s <MOHID_INSTALLATION_PATH>/Mohid/Solutions/mohid-in-linux/bin/MohidWater.exe <YOUR_PROJECT_PATH>/exe/MohidWater.exe
```

## Notes ##
* You must download and install intel compiler C and Fortran first, before run scripts. intel compiler free for 30 days. You can do it here: <https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-parallel-studio-xe>
* If you are a Academic Researcher or a Student you can get intel compiler for free here: <https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software>
* See <https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-parallel-studio-xe-for-linux> to learn more about what to install.
* After installed intel compiler C and fortran, add paths in .bashrc:
```
export INTEL=/opt/intel
export PATH=$PATH:$INTEL/bin:$INTEL/lib/intel64:$INTEL/include:$INTEL/include/intel64
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$INTEL/lib/intel64
export CC=$INTEL/bin/icc
export CXX=$INTEL/bin/icpc
export FC=$INTEL/bin/ifort
export F9X=$INTEL/bin/ifort
export CFLAGS='-O3 -xHost -ip'
export CXXFLAGS='-O3 -xHost -ip'
export FCFLAGS='-O3 -xHost -ip'
```
* Update all paths in scripts
* MOHID must be compiled with the same compiler used in hdf5 and netcdf libraries
* If necessary use ext2uppercase.sh to uppercase all .f90 to .F90 extensions
* If necessary use dos2unix linux command:
` find . -name *.F90 -exec dos2unix {} \; `
* If you want to use MPI, install MPI in your system and make MPI flag true in compile.sh. MPI only work if your project has nested domains.
